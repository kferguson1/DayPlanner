# DayPlanner

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
You'll need to use a library like Moment.js to work with dates and times. Moment.js has historically been the most popular date/time library but is no longer supported by its developers. However, you can still use it for this project, or you can look into one of the following alternatives:
Luxon
Day.js
date-fns
js-Joda
Whichever library you choose, be sure to read the documentation carefully!

Steps
- Added HTML, JS, and CSS Files
- Added Moment Library
- Added jQuery Library
- Added rows for Time of day
- Set  hour functions
- Added CSS border shadow
- Added function to save to local storage
- Created form in html doc
